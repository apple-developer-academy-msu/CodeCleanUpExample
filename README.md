# Oscar's Code Cleanup

## Directions

1. Clone the project
2. Open MessyGroceryListView.swift. The goal is to refactor this file to make the code as clean as possible.
3. When done, the view should look exactly the same. Only the code itself should be different.

## Things to consider:

1. DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself!) - What is being repeated in the file and how could you eliminate the repetition?
2. Swift Style Conventions - What style conventions are not being followed? How can you apply the proper styling conventions to improve readability?
